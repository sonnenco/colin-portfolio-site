              My name is Colin Sonnenberg, and I'm currently a cybersecurity engineer based in Philadelphia.

              My lifelong interest in technology began early â€” some of my first memories involve playing games on our familyâ€™s beige Gateway desktop, complete with a buzzing CRT monitor. 
              As I grew up, the rise of social media and the first wave of smartphones only deepened my fascination with tech and solidified my desire to pursue a technology-focused career.

            <br/>
            <div>
              That path eventually led me to the Pennsylvania State University, where I earned a B.S. in Information Technology and a minor in Security and Risk Analysis. 
              My education opened the door to my first role at EY, where I worked on a range of data protection and privacy projects. 
              This aligned with the emergence of GDPR-style legislation in the U.S. and the development of regulatory bodies tasked with enforcing compliance.
            </div>
            <br />
            <div>
              I later joined Comcast as an information security analyst within the Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) team. 
              Today, I focus on implementing disaster recovery and continuity capabilities across critical security platforms and tools.

              Over time, my work in cybersecurity has led me to collaborate closely with engineering teams, where I found myself increasingly drawn to the technical problem-solving and creativity involved in building software.
              That curiosity has grown into a clear goal: to transition into a full-time software engineering role.
              To support that pivot, I'm currently pursuing a second B.S. in Computer Science from Oregon State University.

              In my free time, youâ€™ll either find me traveling the world with my partner or relaxing at home with our three cats.
